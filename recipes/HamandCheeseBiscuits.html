    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These easy ham and cheese biscuits are so yummy, and you can make them in minutes. A sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning makes is a really nice touch. Serve with cut-up fruit for breakfast, or with a salad for lunch.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16.3 ounce) package jumbo flaky biscuits, such as Pillsbury® Grands! Biscuits with Flaky Layers</li>
        <li>16 thin slices deli ham</li>
        <li>4 (1 ounce) slices Cheddar, Swiss, or Monterrey Jack Cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons everything bagel seasoning, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and line a baking sheet with parchment or foil. If using foil, grease foil lightly.</li>
        <li>Separate dough into 8 biscuits, and place on the prepared sheet pan. Gently tease apart half of each biscuit’s layers, almost to the opposite edge of the biscuit, so it opens up like a book.</li>
        <li>Fold 2 slices of thinly sliced deli ham to fit each biscuit, and place on the bottom half of each biscuit. Top with 1/2 slice of cheese, folded to fit the biscuits. Gently fold top halves of biscuit dough over cheese.</li>
        <li>Brush each biscuit with melted butter and sprinkle with everything seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool about 5 minutes and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
